Up until a few months ago, my wife and I shopped for groceries by going down each aisle and buying whatever looked good.
The result was a large bill and lots of wasted food. More recently, we started planning our meals using links to recipes
online. Our spending instantly fell 25%, we stopped wasting as much food, and we started eating healthier. However, my
wife was finding recipe links online and transcribing the ingredients to a grocery list by hand! It took a lot of time
to not only transcribe the recipes, but also find the links later in the week once we were cooking. In the end, we
decided to create an app to solve our problem.

The basic idea is to add a link to a recipe. The ingredients list is parsed and added to your grocery list. If you need
eggs or milk, you can also add groceries directly to your list. It integrates with other apps like Reminders, Notes, and
Safari, and you can save recipes for later if you ever want to make them again!

Hope you like it!
