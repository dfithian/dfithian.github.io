My wife and I created this app together, in large part because during COVID we were forced to cook all of our meals each
week. After a few weeks we started to dread the time it took to pick out recipes and manually compile a grocery list each
week. As a result, our meal planning didn't last very long and our grocery bill started to increase because we were
shopping without a clear idea of what meals we would make. To combat this, we ended up creating an app that cuts our meal
planning time drastically and automates our grocery list creation. The best part is we found that our grocery bill
decreased a third of what it was before we used the app.

The app transforms the manual process of searching, saving, and transcribing recipes into just a few quick steps:

* Add a link to a recipe.
* The ingredients are parsed and added to your grocery list.
* Add any additional items you need directly to your list.
* Either use the app itself to check off items as you shop or easily export the grocery list to other apps like Reminders, Notes, and Safari.
* Easily save recipes for the future to use again! 

Hope you like it!
