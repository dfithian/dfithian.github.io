My wife and I created this app together, in large part because during COVID we were forced to cook all of our meals each
week. After a few weeks we started to dread the time it took to pick out recipes and manually compile a grocery list each
week. As a result, our meal planning didn't last very long and our grocery bill started to increase because we were
shopping without a clear idea of what meals we would make. To combat this, we ended up creating an app that cuts our meal
planning time drastically and automates our grocery list creation. The best part is we found that our grocery bill
decreased a third of what it was before we used the app.

The app transforms the manual process of searching, saving, and transcribing recipes into just a few quick steps. Here's
how it works!

* Add links to online recipes or define your own
* Nomz adds the ingredients to your grocery list
* You can add to, edit, merge, and reorder your list based on your local grocery store
* Nomz stores each recipe and shares across multiple devices, so when you're ready to cook, tap on the saved link
* Add a rating and notes for the next time you make it!

Hope you like it!
