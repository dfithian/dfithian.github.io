title: Composite 0.6 released
---

I recently released version 0.6 of the [composite](https://github.com/ConferOpenSource/composite)
library on GitHub! It's been a few years since the last release, so the code had stagnated quite a
bit.

The code now compiles with the lastest Stackage LTS. At time of release, that's 14.3!

The main change is incorporation of typeclasses instead of proxies for the underlying vinyl
framework. This has resulted in a few breaking changes to the composite API, mostly in the `-base`
project. Due to the heavy reliance of composite on phantom types, it is now slightly more difficult
to convince the compiler.
[reifyVal](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/composite-base-0.6.0.0/docs/Composite-Record.html#v:reifyVal)
has been provided to assist.

See also: [the changelog](https://github.com/ConferOpenSource/composite/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md).

Any questions or support for the new release can be asked on fpchat (`@dfithian`), or on the
[project issue page](https://github.com/ConferOpenSource/composite/issues/).
