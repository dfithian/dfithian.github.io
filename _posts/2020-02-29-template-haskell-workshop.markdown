Recently I've been thinking about how little information there is out there on Template Haskell or other
boilerplate-erasing libraries. In Haskell we have plenty of tools for deriving, or generics, or macro-generated Template
Haskell, but tutorials or documentation are not always readily available. Today I'm writing to announce that I have
posted a Template Haskell workshop on [my GitHub](https://github.com/dfithian/th-workshop) in case anyone wants more
exposure to learning about it or using it.

As are all tutorials, this workshop is in-progress, so if you have any feedback I'd love to hear it! The easiest place
to find me is on fpchat (@dfithian).
